# Grammatical-Error-Detection
This model is built to find whether a given sentence is grammatically correct or not. This model is based on LSTMs and deep neural network layers. The model predicts
the probability of correctness of the sentence and, depending on the threshold limit set gives the answer accordingly. The model gave an accuracy of 71.2% on the test set.
This work was done is association with the Keral Infrastructure for Technology and Education (KITE). The next step is to build a model that not only classifies models but also corrects the incorrect sentences.

Libraries used:
- Tensorflow
- Keras
